# Valid Phone

## About project

Every contact form I built required the user to enter their phone number. Basic form would allow the user to enter phone number and data gets saved in database as a character field.

This simple form works, but there were no checks to make sure phone number is correct. Input was being validated for numbers and length of characters.

To improve the user experience, I wanted to format the input phone number in user-defined locale format and also make sure it is valid.
