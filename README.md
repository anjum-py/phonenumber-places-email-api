# Hi

This repository is my first portfolio project built using FastAPI, Typer and Redis Stack.

I have been working with Django for a couple of years now and built a couple of websites that required collecting user information such as name, phone number, email, and address. Although these forms served their purpose, they did very little in terms of enhancing user experience. User could enter anything and user input was going through rudimentary validation.  I came across FastAPI while learning about designing and building microservices architecture using Python. FastAPI's awesome documentation helped me understand not only about FastAPI but a lot more about Python, type annotations, asynchronous code, OAuth, Pydantic models, and more.

Now, I have learnt new patterns that could help me create scalable and maintainable solutions, and this is my attempt to start building smaller but helpful tools that I could use in any number of places.

## About this project

This project is a collection of helpful tools from various open source projects, so it is only befitting that this project be also open source.
